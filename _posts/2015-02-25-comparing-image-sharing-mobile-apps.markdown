# Comparing Image Sharing Social Apps- Part II



Here is the list of the Apps I’m going to do a review on:

Tinder, Whisper, Snapchat, Instagram, Unseen and Fade. This list includes the apps that have succeeded; that is, they have more than 100,000 active (daily) users. At the end of the day, the one measure of an Apps success that no one can deny is the market itself.

Disclaimer: I’m not an alpha user of any of these apps. But over the past year, I’ve been following them actively; I have followed their team building, their app development and their market growth. Since all my input is in some ways second-hand information, I will make sure that this post is as technical as possible, making it as timeless as possible.

Tinder:

Nicely done! Love this work. Their name is not the best thing they’ve got, but it’s fun. Their icon is even better, it’s truly an icon. Who remembers Pandora’s icon? no one. Tinder has a freaking shape, it is symbol, the flame, and not a letter, and of course it has its signature reddish color. Tinder’s main success is in the fact that they don’t mess around: you just see the pics, no comments, no likes, no nothing. That is not just simplicity, that is their Mojo! Their swiping animation is A class design work. Sure there are buttons, but the main tasks, liking, skipping, and zooming, are done by swiping. Each pic is done one at a time. On this app, setting the location or signing up and signing in with Facebook, to me, is mostly about keeping the time and focus on what matters: the pictures. Instead of making an app that runs your GPS all the time and queries 24/7, this app sets your location less frequently, saving you some battery power. This app, could be about sharing images in downtown. It could be about sharing photos at 2pm to 3 pm. Still, many teams got motivated and made Tinder for this and Tinder for that but they are really lying on a bigger golden egg than what they think they have: the geolocation proximity.

1- User Profile: it’s Facebook Profile, that means the most reliable one, for a dating app, this is not a decision, this is a give-in. You can’t exist in the dating world and not be using Facebook profile. Facebook, pushes himself to be a utility platform, it was the first application that made you put your email, then your phone number, and now your real name and last name. Next thing you know they’ll have you adding your social security number! If it seems like a joke to you, you should know it is a mission of the team. So, don’t forget: if you are a dating app and you are not using Facebook, you will have a lot to worry about.

2- User Culture: Anyone who dislikes the phrase “hook-up culture” should know that Tinder is the bad guy. And like every great movie that has a great bad guy, this is actually a bad-ass bad guy. It’s hard to kill him, but he is not infallible either. If you are a girl on Tinder, chances are that you have one pic on the beach, one pic going crazy with your girls, one pic of you posing in the center with few classy guys and the rest just about your main body features. If you are an alpha user, you don’t have any Bio, you know you don’t need one because it’s all about pictures. Maybe, just maybe, you add your Insta link just in case. This is the culture. You don’t like it, well, too bad cause the closest to Tinder in now called Tumbler which is only on Windows phones, with Geo Option active.

3- Main User demographics: All good looking guys/girls. By now we all now this number is at about 10 million on our beautiful planet earth. Fun fact: the number of downloads for the app is, approximately, 200 million. That means every user for the past two years has been downloading this app, on average, 20 times, That is they remove the app and install it every other month. (that was supposed to be funny :o ).

4-Content Relevancy: It’s GPS location. Don’t get fooled by the number of friends in common or the shared interest that is pulled off of your Facebook. Nobody in tech should take Facebook static information off a person as his real things. I like Jeff Bozo because I thought he was cool. Those are features that don’t matter, those are the little white flowers around the red rose in your bouquet, the rose is the GPS. Show me who is close. Dealing with a GPS and making it work fast is not easy. It takes time and getting the right accuracy is tricky. Tinder just works, this is another clue that they knew their main battle: Location, location, location.

5-Sense of Community: Finding a sense of community with an application involving hookup culture is almost impossible. This is one reason why monitoring any dating apps is always a challenge. Zoosk did an unique job at his time in the web on this and Tinder definitely will do his own one day as well, with their Passport feature perhaps. For an application, with such a high rate of app removal and re-installation, the Sense of Community barely exists. If you want to know why, the movie The Breakfast Club nails it.

6-Launch Strategy: They started as a campus app only, like many others, they first paid some sororities to get on the app and they focused all their attention on only getting the female side of the equation. With a good first foot, they started to grow a controlled environment for their male demographics. Let’s say, they took this as basically their marking effort. They got a short paragraph in the university news and boom they were “Take-Off”. The Launch strategy is that part of the history that is often changed to favor the winner. So, it’s reasonable to assume it’s not always what it is out there. TBC.

7- Mojo: Not caring about anything else but the location. When you read what I wrote, you should pay attention to what I didn’t say: I didn’t say it’s Location, or Just pics, or Facebook login. I said it is not caring about anything else, but Location. In the past post, I mentioned few ways that Tinder could have lost his Mojo. But really, working with GPS data and query them every time a user gets on his phone is not an easy challenge to undertake.

Whisper

Whisper, an app that failed to Launch right the first time. It’s just so hard to flip when things start bad. They had a bad android code for a long time, keeping records in variables instead of a database and not doing a fine job on Error-Handling. Now, the Android code seems better. They have worked on their Location functionality a lot more. But, like I said, re-launching a user-front-end based app is harder than launching it the first time. Overall, the idea is fine, the execution is taking longer than normal to update.

1- User Profile: it’s not public, aka it’s anonymous. This is what they got uniquely handled and advertised. They don’t shout that they are anonymous, they just are. When you remove an app and re-install it the Posts still show in your account, the user thinks it doesn't fade away, so he starts to be more cautious of what he is saying. They only take a four digit number as a passcode and there is no Sign Up stage. No Password, no repeat Password, I don’t know why do some teams still do Repeat Password, while no one would ever log out, no Name, no number! Well the last one is not true, they already record the phone number in their App permission request section. But who cares?

2- User Culture: Mostly at my school, I see posts about dating, meetups, etc. They heavily rely on texting and writing. This is not interesting. Their pictures are all high quality pictures that they only offer and the user should select. This is good, since the quality of the images is going to always be A-class. But, by giving that equation an answer they already limited themselves to a visual Yik-Yak or Tinder at their bests.

3- Main User Demographics: Loners, folks going through mental stresses, people who have social anxiety, and maybe those who have a hard time connecting with the people who love them. Whisper has a limited audience, but that’s not bad, that’s okay. The bad part is that their demographic is so spread out, it can be anyone from a 18 year old boy in high school struggling to socialize to a 60 year old veteran who is constantly living in his past trauma. They do not connect with a cause they connect with the symptom. What will they talk about on the app? The only thing that they have in common is the fact that they are depressed.

4- Content Relevancy: Instead of showing me something that matters to me, they have different groups, each about one main type of contents. The reality is always more interesting, than just plain grouping of things. No matter who you are, how old you are or where you are, you will still see the same contents. To me they really don’t have content relevancy but I’m sure from their perspective, they are working on it.

5- Sense of Community: This might shock you: they have a stronger sense of community than Tinder. What they aim to achieve is actually a high goal: share what bothers you here and we listen to you. Maybe you have no one to trust, maybe you have realized you have no real friends that won’t be judging you, maybe … what ever the reason, share it here. This is a beautiful community.

6-Launch Strategy: At a $200 M evaluation, we still don’t know how many users they have. Last year they raised $20M. One person asked me, “how do they intend to use the money?” I said “to hire people and scale.” Let’s get it a Fermi solution: there is around 1 mill downloads reported on their android app store and we know it is true. Let’s assume they have more android users than iPhone users. Let’s also assume the user removes the app at least as much as they remove Tinder from their phone, that’s once a month, so that would leave them with around less than 100,000 active whisperer-s. They are still a lot more interesting to investors, because they have a strong sense of community.

7- Mojo: A great picture collection. What I mean by that is the high quality of their pictures. Just as importantly, their recommendation system for matching a picture with a text is powerful and nicely done. Note, that I didn’t say “pictures,” I said, “high quality pictures.” I also didn’t say being anonymous with great pictures. It would have been a different app if they had utilized their lack of identity differently.

What they got wrong: nothing, it is a challenging idea that is definitely ahead of its time. It may take quite sometime for it to really find itself and find the way users will really use it. A long maturation period is actually a good sign of an application that will last.
