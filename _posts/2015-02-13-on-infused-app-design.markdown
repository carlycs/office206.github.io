# What is a infused App Design?

An infused app design is an approach where the main app functionality, what developers like to talk about, and the look and feel, what designers like to call as the soul or character of the app and the launch, what your investor like to tell you that he has a lot of experience in, all considered from the day one. Some may say it’s not possible, true but this approach gives the holistic approach it’s true pedestal by making everything as simple as possible. 

Let’s go over an example: 

You’re designing and building an image sharing app, you know you want to start with its launch in your own university and until you raise a team with a garage money of 30 or 80K you will be only limited to universities. You pick a main theme color, or two, and you base your app, on up voting. The icon you will use for up-voting, becomes your logo, brand icon, your icon on the app store and you don’t have any concept of profile. So all that you have to ask you will ask during the first two to five screens of your sign up process. The main functionalities are seeing pictures in a picture stream and taking images and uploading them with a text. This is all you know and this is all you need to start working on an app. If some one asks, what are you working on, you will say, I’m working on an image sharing social app which is college based. Having all these three aspects of your app: Design, Development and Launch makes a lot of things clear and your final product a “cool” one. 

What makes pivoting really a frustrating process is not finding the “not working” approach, it’s in the fact that changing one major decision, regarding either of the major three aspects, Design, Develop and Launch, heavily affects everything else to an extent that it’s just too much “re-work”.
