#A Rather Nerdy Review on the Image Sharing Apps: A note for the next Big Thing Doers

Well, first few things about me so anyone who is reading this post, gives the merits for what it’s worth and no more.

Who I am: I’m a tech guy, I enjoy a clean build just by looking at it, I code in Android and iPhone and as my day job I’m an application specialist for a computing cluster network at a research institute with an engineering degree, I know it sounds cool but this basically means on a daily basis I work on a terminal which to many could be boring. But as a result, I really appreciate the logistics of taking a picture, uploading a picture and have a hungry eye for a good user experience. For example, when I take a picture on an app I find, I may look at the data I use for uploading and I compare it to the actual file size of the image trying to figure out how many addresses on a cluster the picture is pushed to, and while I do my best to isolate this experiment I would also open a tab on a browser and quora search their team and also tracerout their servers on a terminal to see what amazon servers it is running on. It’s bad. Who I’m not: I’m really not the alpha user of most of these apps, nor am I the person who can see into their future.

Disclaimer: This post is originally all my opinions so it lacks major stats or actual user’s experience.

The challenge:

The challenge of photo-sharing apps, is mostly coming from “what the user is gonna post” question. No matter how many options you put into reporting a picture, how you manage the user identity on your app, how you pay attention to a slick clean design in order to build a fine habitat for your users to endure and cherish, the thought of the “chat roulette” hunts you! A friend once told me he knows someone whose main daily job was just to remove the “D” pictures on a dating website. If it is full-time paying job in DC for someone to clean the contents you can imaging the challenge of avoiding it in the first place. Random pictures like a table in a kitchen or creative posts of users of their newly overhauled body right after their gym sessions do exists as well, but they are the easy spices. On a different perspective, what your app should generate is “good” contents to your users, it is ok if it also creates some poor contents along the way, but in the long run if you can make the good ones keep coming, you will self-correct the community one way or the other. I think “poor contents”, means when a they don’t have much value for your users, examples are when the room is just plain dark or when the image quality is low or just not clear what it is about. Also, nobody knows what is a “good contents” exactly. And what makes it a high risk challenge? Handling an image is not easy nor simple. It’s also costly. There are a lot at stake if an app fails to create good contents over a short launch time period as well as over a long time frame. An image is a big file compared to ten-word yak. So this means that you can only do so much pivoting when you launch an app based on images, high-cost-failure.

I’m going to propose a design skeleton based on the following seven pillars and want to talk about the few apps that are out there on image sharing in the next post. Remember, in the end of the day, all of these corner stones matter, for image sharing social apps, where the stakes are high. Other apps do have all these seven concepts but let’s face it, if you are teaching me how to speak italian, it’s ok if you don’t have a strong sense of community. Also, by image sharing social apps, I mean apps where users are hanging out mostly around images. So basically most of the apps: Tinder, Instagram, Unseen, Snapchat and even facebook, a webish one, are some examples.

Here we go:

1- User Profile: To have a user profile or not to have a user profile. This is big. The moment a user has a name on it, no matter if it is a real one or not, it affects the user and how he uses the app. And if an email is attached to a user that others users can see, this will be game changer. I’m a different person on Instagram than on snapchat’s Our Story. Why most anonymous apps fail or have a hard time to pick up, is because they think every anonymous app is the same- no they are not. Some are anonymous but they don’t shout it or even mention it anywhere, some think they should sell on that anonymity- bad idea- some do that but they also list in their privacy policy and user terms that they can remove the picture if a person is “identifiable”. Again, no two apps are the same here and the team needs to really figure out where they stand with this question.

2- User Culture: If you have ever seen this comment “this is twitter, it’s not yikyak.” or “this is not snapchat” you know the app is set to take off. That a “culture” is established. A culture on an app is basically like the Terms of User and Privacy Policy except that every one reads and unknowingly follows. The word “selfie” was the word of the year in 2013 by Oxford dictionary thanks to Instagram culture. As a result one acts differently on different apps. This is very closely related to the people who make the app happen. The Design matters, are you using all the screen? Can users swipe instead of clicking on small button here and there to do stuff? How many clicks I am away to post on this app? But the engineering of it is as important: do you upload the picture before I even comment on it so I see the sweet “Success” message right after or do I have to look at the rotating snake? How easy is it to remove an image or to comment on one?

3- Main User Demographics:

Disclaimer: this is not an easy topic for me to talk about because I personally don’t like labeling and I do want to talk about it too much. I don’t like labels. I’m a firm believer in “Ands”. You are always “white” and “something else”. You are always “a hot chick” and “someting else”. I think no matter how small is that label, it’s rude if it applied to one particular person without the “ands”. Other names for this labeling are “racist”, “sexist”, “frat”, “hot chick”, “good mother”, etc. Working with statistical computing softwares for over a year and doing consulting, I would say what is called a “sexist” is simply a statistical conclusion applied on a real human being- which is wrong ethically and a of course a poor judgment driven by oversimplification. How it’s a hate crime in some countries: when this statistical test is used on one particular person, treating people as a model, box, assuming they have no other dimension is like stealing from them. But in a mobile application you don’t get to be fully yourself, and that’s a fact. You would never be fully yourself but a simplified version of yourself. It would just represent your major most dominant features that is best rewarded by that application community. And as the numbers of downloads goes up, those stats do fit better.

4- Content Relevancy: if I’m a straight guy, I’m more into seeing pictures of the opposite sex. If I’m 19, I want to know more about the under 21 fellows at my campus, not a 24 yo grad student research lab. Or I could be like: “Don’t show me a picture of a open fridge.” “Oh, this is my neighbor’s fridge?” “Ok, that one I wanna see!”. That’s what I mean by Content Relevancy.

5- Sense of Community: so…what? I saw a picture, and lilly_xoxo posted it. Can I comment on it? Can I report it? How easy is it to report it by the way? Cause sure as hell I won’t click three times to tell you that I don’t like to see this picture right now because of this or that looking for your small buttons when I’m in a toilet and have a lot of other things to think about as well. If I like it, or if I don’t can tell that loser or winner about it? And again, how hard are you gonna make it for me to do it? Should I click a button and then another small button? Sorry, too hard.



6- Launch Strategy: well, this one is make it or break it. Depending , I think the launch strategy can be more than 50 percent of the whole execution. Should the team just upload the app to the store and beta-test? And then keep it up on a two week push-basis plan and grow the user reach? You need my college edu email? Or is it location based? Every one under 21? Why should everything be for the over 21? Answer me. Should I be from this neighborhood to use all the features of your app? And the elements of this decision grows. You can get really creative. You wanna find a good one? Look at Kickstarter. This is what they do after all! They just launch campagnes. I love that “Go Fund Yourself” episode on the Southpark. Will you share with your users about your goal? Good, cause I think you should. You are building a community after all, not just an app.

7- Mojo. Yes, your app mojo. It’s your charm, your game, the spell your app casts on your loving users. Tinder is about just “few” pics, if Tinder had ten pictures it wasn’t interesting. If Tinder had a simpler way to add a text or show it it wasn’t interesting. It would lost its Mojo. Snapchat is about a fading picture. If tomorrow they launch a campaign saying now this time these picture would last for ever it would loose its Mojo. It’s called the spell so the stranger the better. And it should never change once the app picks up. So it should be something that enables. That makes some users do something. So to really pull it off, it should exist from the day one in your minds of the team. This is basically the answer you want your users to say to the question. “oh, what is it about?”. If your users don’t have an answer for this one, they are not really buying. The Mojo is the last item but it’s still important. If you make it happen you are a magician as a builder and you should buy yourself a beer. For an app that picks up quickly this bonus is something that has been around from the day one. When your team has figured it out for the its app, it makes so many other design decisions simple and will make them a real design question with one soul not just some random patching work each taken from other existing apps.

I’ve listed these seven design criteria based on the priority of each topic and like a wise man once said, it’s our priorities that makes us. I think it does end to a complete different execution of the app if a team switches the order. So, here it goes again:

1- User Profile

2- User Culture

3- Main User Demographics

4- Content Relevency

5- Sense of Community

6- Launch Strategy

7- Mojo
