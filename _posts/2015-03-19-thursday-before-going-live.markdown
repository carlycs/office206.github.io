#Thoughts on a Thursday, four days before going live

put an image header. 

Need to set up the web and mobile to track things better. 

Assigning time tables and task sheets for founders for massive amount of emails.

*Even phone calls should be converged into emails.*

Cancel anything meantime to focus on the next two weeks planning. 
we have a limited resources, time, man-hour, money... name it. We are limited in everything so we need a protocol and task sheet for the next two weeks. 


Looking at our Menu better and have eagle view on our contents, our market and ourself.


Switching gears as a team. 
i've been solopreneur for the most part of most of my projects. And for every business there is very little that can be copy-pasted. there are traints in common but they all take a huge toll to get traction. With this project I see the team that is heavily a factor and I want to make sure it has its stage. 



Going viral can be an epic fail. 
I think we will have 25 orders for the first week and four photoshooting nights. We will start to see what to scale in my business model, any more licenses needed for our work and planning out a Certified Ambassadors program to create a new pipeline in place to attract the right people for our service. 


Day to day, start documenting your procedures.

is our menue really what our fav. customer need the most when they first start to work with us?

What are the first three scalable dimensions in our service for the first three weeks?

Is everyone in the team ready to switch gears as a team?
I do believe in the concept of MVT, minimum viable team, a team that can start and be fit-enough to make it through the first lap. 
I also believe that the team needs to graduate into a more strucutred team as the time passes by. Giving a team a structure calls the trade-off point for manuouverability(responsiveness to market) and scalability (stability) and for us I think it is a two to three year degree! There is alot to know about the market and our products that we don't know at this stage. 


Long thoughts:
Researching the top ten media we like to see our work featured in if something newsworthy happens for our business. 

Has our intuition been talking to me?
What's it telling me to do? what ever it is don't delay. Intution is not pationt will leave if you don't listen.

In the end, little prepration on most of the major tasks will make us ready for the coming weeks.
