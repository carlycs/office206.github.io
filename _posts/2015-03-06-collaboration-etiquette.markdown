I'm following a good discussion called "what drives us crazy?" Definitely opened my eyes to what frustrates designers, so I want to start a discussion around the same topic for software engineers. What drives you crazy? I don't want this to become a complaint thread, think of it as a way to educate your non-engineering colleagues on how to better interact.


There is a type of conversation that I have encountered many times during my career, in different teams, projects and cultures. Usually this is more important when the size of the team is small and the dynamics high. It often happens during the initial stages, first six months when it's basically a times of pressure, and it always involves someone critizing as if some one watching a "run" would be critisizing the "runner" or the "competition" or the "weather". Senarious are alot: the engineering or product development commenting on the visual designner work, team leader wanting to do the developer job, designers comment on how the dev. side is taking credit for their work while their side of work actually sucks. Usually the person providing the critique is higher in hierarchy than the reciever, but doesn’t have authority over them. 

In the past, I have seen heated debates, upset developers and dienchanted designers, frustrated members of the marketing side cause the product is not living up to their promises, and business or sales team, feeling that they are not allowed to enter in a "product talk" or pass thier voice and their opinion on how things are working out there in real market.

In an attempt to close the gap and to help with cross-functional communication in my current small teams, I decided to write a short guide about the best way to provide feedback and to influence products decisions. What you find here you can find partially here, partially here and here.


Tip #1: Never use the words “I hate it”, or “it looks like it was designed by an engineer”, or "can we use this- showing a template- instead, or "I don't like it this way"

As much as you may want to express your feelings and frustrations, these words are not helpful. It doesn’t give anyone any details on what you don’t like about the work, design, etc., and we can’t make any changes based on this. Furthermore, it immediately creates tension, and more junior Founders might take this type of feedback personally.


Tip #2: Be specific

Using phrases like “the alignment seems off” or “there is no visual hierarchy on the page” is a good start. It allows us to respond and bring up technical limitations if they are the reason for some of the decisions.


Tip #3: Tell us what you do like and why

If you come across design solutions that work for you, please share them. We are always open to new approaches and we love to be inspired. Depending on the business and branding goals of our company, we may incorporate some of the ideas into our product.


Tip #4: Pick your battles

If you don’t like a particular icon, or if you think that a font size needs to be bumped up 1 pixel, try and ask yourself if either opinion is subjective. It’s possible that we have gotten the exact opposite feedback from someone else in the company. We evaluate feedback carefully and make sure not to react to anything that is based solely on personal taste.


Tip #5: I am not a designer, but...

Please don’t start a sentence with these words. Regardless of what you mean, what we hear is something like “...even though I have no formal training as a designer, I can do much better than you...”.


Tip #6: Don’t micromanage

If you start telling us things like “move this 3 pixels up” or “use a darker grey here” we feel like you want to do our job for us. Again, this is not helpful and creates tension. A much better way to communicate is to talk about the goal of the page, the hierarchy of the elements and how they relate to each other. Saying things like “the main goal of the page is to promote the product, while social sharing is not important” is great.


Tip #7: Talk about your day-to-day challenges

It helps us to empathise if you tell us a little bit about your world, and why you are worried about the design. Sharing your goals with us creates the bigger picture and brings your feedback in context. Ideally, this would be part of gathering requirements before starting with a designs, but it’s not always realistic.


Tip #8: Be open and listen

Sometimes, there are technical limitations and reasons why the designs turned out the way they are. Maybe we don’t have the type of content that supports our ideal design. or perhaps the best solution would take a week to implement. Sometimes, the current design is just the first step towards something much more rich and exciting, and we have to work on a backend feature first.


Tip #9: Trust us

Mutual trust and respect is key. If you assume that we did the best we could, the conversation is less likely to become personal. Maybe the reason why you are not happy with the design is time constraints, or perhaps the design team was not aware of your business goal.

It all comes down to being treated as partners who have the same goal in mind. If we remember that we all want to create a successful product, it (hopefully) will be easier to collaborate and work towards that goal together.
