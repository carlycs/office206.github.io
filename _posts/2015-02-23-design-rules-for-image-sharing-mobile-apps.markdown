# Design Rules to Remember: for an Image Sharing Mobile App


The Design, includes form and functionality as one whole. Usually people think of the design as the form only. The wholeness of the design of the app is when all the elements of your app are in sync. That is, let’s say you want to design a “reporting” functionality in your app. Now, the report button should be where it makes the most sense: as close as the image-view for your images. In your app, if the user has a profile that others can see, there is no need to also worry about how convinient this button is. So, this decision goes hand in hand with the fact wether your app, has a vieable profile or not. Now, what happens when you click on the report button? Should that image be not queued for other users on there stream? Should there be a confirmation messege too? Maybe an alert box that is on the center of the image view, covering it? You see all these decisions should make perfect sense in a way that one can tell an incomplete design versus a completed draft but still viable.





Let’s pick the Report Button example again, since it represents a simple design case but will easily get messy as we’ll see: To start this design task the common mistake is that people start from designing a reporting “button”. If you start from there, the issue is that you have already made a very important design decision: “Let’s use a button for it”.

Now let’s take one step back, a good mobile app pushes the hardware and software. Stay away from small buttons as much as possible. Why do you need buttons for? The problem with buttons is the user should look for a specific part of the screen, called a button, and click it which is like a poking it, it is an sudden action that should be elicited by the user and the user needs to see the reaction in a shorter time span than his clicking which is about half a second. That small time frame limits your creativity. It stresses the users because they want to see the reaction right away or they will “poke” again and then again until they become what I call “clickish” user or the app crashes. Your user was a nice person who was interested give your app a try and you are turning him into a “clickish”, stressed-out user. The fact that we still live with button views and their controllers is because we follow the keyboard mentality from PCs: you have to click a button to put an input into the machine. But it doesn’t have to be the same for phones, since now mostly have touch screens. So, from punching codes to flippping nubs to clicking buttons and now we are at the stage interacting with a screen that can understand multi touch, swiping, etc.

Be mobile, use the screen touch functions as much as possible. Simply because it is “nicer” to “swipe” than to “click”. Now, from a typical user, this doesn’t make sense, he is basically ok with it as far as the reward is coming: the button works. But if you are a developer you should imagine 50,000 people, clicking on a button and another 50,000 people swiping to get the same thing happen. That is almost like a semi-full stadium of people on their phone- let’s say they have signal too. Now, which group you think would cheer their team stronger after an hour of being on their apps? Go with that. Now, let’s say you say, “swipers” are happier people. Then I’ll ask, swipe to where? As a right-hand person, you swipe to right easier with your thumb than to left and then by a margin you swipe easier down than swiping up. Your user, doesn’t care much, but again as a designer you should: the task that you like to be done more often, “liking” a picture should be swipe right, and the one you don’t like to happen, because it is not in line with the main goal of your app, should be swipe left. So, this is the Design that will work. You can’t have a designer work on your app without him knowing what is exactly the goal of the app. The design of the app, only in this sense, can connect the form and the functionality. And when it’s done right, it’s like a good balance of puzzle solving and painting. Of course, you can disagree and say I think buttons are mostly used and users are already expect buttons. Then, you desing a different product than me but the point is that this should be a decision to make.



Design wireless: A good hardware product is something that doesn’t have a wire. The problem is that we can’t get rid of the wire, since it’s the cheapest way to plug things into electric network that runs our cities with electricity, as of 2015. In fifty years, this might not be true. So as designer you probably have this inner push to live at a different time, hopefully ahead of you which means you should always design for a future you are looking for.

Stay away from Buttons. Already talked about it in the intro part. Be nice to your users, don’t use buttons. Or if you want to use it, use it for things that you like your users to do the least: signing out ☺

Stay away from steps, keep everything in one level with no hierarchy. I explained this in a separate post here. It also helps you to have your users always mentally “signed-in”.

Know how the mind works, assume maximum laziness on the user side and 100 percent smartness.


Meet your user: 100 percent lazy, 100 percent smart. Introducing you new levels of both year after year! That’s an electric solowheel btw.


Put up to five actions in your app, use visual hints, avoid words and texts that needs to be read as much as possible.

Start with a one page app. It’s not a good sign if you don’t know the exact design and you also want to start with a TabViewController. Explain to your team why you need a profile screen. Maybe not.

Stay away from Text Boxes. Typing one some apps is one very annoying feature that kilss them, text claw is real! It’s 80 percent a market insinated cultural thing, in china people mostly send each other short voice messeges, cause it’s free. Here data is expensive and texting is mostly free. It’s also a habit for teens. But, they are the easiest group to break their habits too. Now if you want it, to make your app suddenly a social app, think twice about how you want to make it happen. Let’s assume words will not stay around if the data plan price drops to a third of what it is today in three years from now, would you still design your app around text boxes? While your business model has over a six year maturation?

Why are you not native? There is no value in a work is a patch work when it comes to software that is even more true. There is so many hardwares your team need to get the app working on them later in the life span of your app.
