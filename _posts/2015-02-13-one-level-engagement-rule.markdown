#One Level Rule: For App Developers, A Design Perspective



If you have are familiar with Rorschach test, you have learned that it’s hard to expect the user to stay interested and patient while looking at the last card. In this test, the study is shown eight images, asked to describe the parts he remembers the best and the features that stands out for him. He also knows how many cards he is going to be shown, while at the last card the “test” is expected to be done and therefore not paying as much attention. This is called mentally “sign-out”. In architecture, good designers like to use curves to hide the “ending” of a long corridor for the same reason: not seeing the destination makes the walk more interesting although distant open horizons are beautiful and entertaining. This “sign-out” mode is definitely not new to teachers: in the last five minutes of the class the students are already at the edge of their seat to leave the class. And from a developer/designer point we don’t like this, we don’t like the user to leave the app, or feel that they are about to “be done”. The One-Level rule is all about keeping the user always in the “signed-in” mode. And by that, it should now be clear that, I mean mentally signed-in. So how do you do that?

One way to do it so to avoid any hierarchy, everything is put in one level, that is to say that there is no order. Every feature of the app is just equally as important. Also, the items should be limited to five or six max or it would become an app that attracts the word “confusing” a lot in its App Store comments.

So, don’t do an app where the user has to open another ViewController to pass a “main” action. Don’t create a Log-out button, you don’t want the user to log-out why then provide one?! And keep the tab buttons to max four.
