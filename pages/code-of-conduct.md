This is a copy of the Lotus Group code of conduct reformated originally from the Python Code of Conduct and [18F Code of Conduct](https://github.com/18F/code-of-conduct/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md) and is a live document meaning it is being updated as we get new projects and learn more. 


### Creating a culture of distruption

We aspire to create a culture where people work joyfully and communicate openly. Hard work and laughter are not mutually exclusive we believe and communicating openly about things that matter in the right order while building credebility are two signs of our culture. We would like our team and our clients to reflect the diversity that is not necessarily cherished today in America, in race, gender, religeon, color of skin, place of birth and technical background. As a Founder, with a Technical background in Engineering and business I also want to foster diversity of technical and skillset background &mdash;not just be another footer or disclaimer in a job posting. I believe in Diversity. Diverse teams are creative teams. We need a diversity of perspective to create solutions for the real and urgent challenges.

This is the Lotus Group Code of Conduct. We expect everyone who works with Lotus Group, attends Lotus Group events and meetings, or participates in online forums or other virtual collaboration to follow this code of conduct and the laws and policies mentioned above. This applies to all of our methods of communication: office chatrooms, commit descriptions and messages, emails, and both formal and informal conversation.

### Show, Show always what you say 

Consider what you can do to encourage and support others. Make room for quieter voices to contribute and listen. Listening is a harder skill to develope comparing to talking or speaking. But never forget to show what you talk about. Offer support and enthusiasm for great ideas in words and make sure you find a way to also show it in other ways. Leverage the low cost of using words to support your colleagues' ideas, but demostrate solutions with building it in real world in a simple quick work. When someone offers something unexpected, look for ways you can contribute and collaborate. Find ways to make things happen rather than finding reasons for it to fail. Share your knowledge and skills in words but never stop there, always show it in your work. Prioritize asking for a reference to asking for an opinion. 

### Boundaries

Create boundaries to your own behavior and consider how you can create safe space that helps prevent unacceptable behavior by others. If you are unsure if something is appropriate behavior, it probably isn’t. Follow this when ever you are in doubt. Each person you interact with can define where that line is for them. *People forget what you say but not how you make them feel.* Problems happen when we assume things without confirmation from the other party. This is particularly problematic when we are in a position of power or privilege.

Here are a few examples of unacceptable behavior:

* Negative or offensive remarks based on race, gender, religion, color of skin, sex (with or without sexual conduct and including pregnancy and sexual orientation involving transgender status/gender identity, and sex-stereotyping), national origin, age, disability (physical or mental), genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity, parental status, marital status, and political affiliation **as well as** gender expression, mental illness, socioeconomic status or background, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, or clothing.  **Consider that calling attention to differences can feel alienating.**


* Sustained disruption of meetings, talks, or discussions, including chatrooms.

* Patronizing language or behavior.

* Aggressive and micro-aggressive behavior, such as unconstructive criticism, providing corrections that do not improve the conversation (sometimes referred to as "well actually"s), repeatedly interrupting or talking over someone else, feigning surprise at someone’s lack of knowledge or awareness about a topic, or subtle prejudice (for example, comments like “That’s so easy my grandmother could do it.”).
