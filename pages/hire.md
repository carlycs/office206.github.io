lead: Let’s work together to design services and products that empower your team, better serve your customers, and tackle the big problems facing your agency.
---

We can work with you to explore and define a variety of problems, and then we can help you build or buy a solution.

We select our projects through a
qualification and evaluation process led by my Agency Partnerships
Team and a feasability meeting. If you and Lotus decide that we’re the right fit for a project and
we have the necessary time and resources, I’ll work with you to draft
the necessary documents to begin our partnership. You can read more
about how I'm building the work with other agencies in my [Partnership
Playbook](https://lotustech.io/partnership-playbook/).

Lotus is not a funded compnay, which means that I do not receive
appropriated fundings from any investor and I must charge an hourly rate for any small consulting project. 

Do you have a project in mind? Let me know: [hp@lotustech.io](mailto:hp@lotustech.io)
